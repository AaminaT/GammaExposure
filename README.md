# GammaExposure
GEX Chart Development using R

Because of my interest in the stock market, I have learned about several charting techniques. One such technique I came across was gamma exposure. Because gamma exposure helps traders, such as me, see the delta-hedging activity of market makers, I decided to learn more about how to calculate and display GEX charts (call, puts, and total gamma).

I was able to combine my interest in stock market analysis with my tools I developed through my classes. Through this project, I learned how to gather data, filter data using a dataframe, develop charts using plotly, and calculate gamma using online resources. I was also able to conduct sound analysis based on the charts I have developed. I have acquired more knowledge to predicit sentiments for stock options based on the market maker's activity.
